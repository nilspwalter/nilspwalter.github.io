I am a second year Ph.D. student at  <a href="https://cispa.de/en"> CISPA Helmholtz Center for 
Information Security</a>, supervised by <a href="https://vreeken.eu/"> Jilles Vreeken</a>.
I am broadly interested in robust and explainable machine learning for large-scale real-world
applications. In my Ph.D, I intend to develop new approaches that
are at the same time descriptive and predictive. That is the models not only offer predictive
capabilities but also facilitate practitioners to gain deeper insights into the problems they
are addressing. Currently, I mostly work on understanding how neural networks process information
and contextualize when and how models make errors.<br>

Before joining CISPA, I was a research assistant in the goup of <a href="https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/people/bernt-schiele"> Bernt Schiele </a>
at the <a href="https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/de/home"> Max-Planck-Institut for Informatics</a>, supervised by
<a href = "https://davidstutz.de/"> David Stutz </a>. My research focused on adversarial 
and out-of-distribution robustness of Quantized Neural Networks.
I also worked on the influence of Batch Normalization on the vulnerability and generalization
capabilities of neural networks.
